## Exploratory Data Analysis Summary

Based on the initial exploratory data analysis of the complaints data, several key findings emerged:

The dataset contains a large number of complaints, with **9,609,797 records** and 18 columns. The majority of columns are of `object` dtype, indicating textual or categorical data, except for 'Complaint ID', which is an integer. There are significant numbers of missing values in several columns, most notably in 'Tags' (**8,981,029 missing**), 'Consumer disputed?' (**8,841,498 missing**), and 'Consumer complaint narrative' (**6,629,041 missing**). The 'Consumer complaint narrative' column is particularly sparse, with a large proportion of records missing this information.

Analyzing the distribution of complaints by 'Product' revealed that 'Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports' and 'Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports' account for the vast majority of complaints. The analysis of the 'Consumer complaint narrative' length showed a wide range of word counts, although a significant number of complaints have no narrative provided. After filtering the dataset to include only specified product types, the dataframe contains **776,742 records**. After removing records without narratives, the remaining dataset is considerably smaller with **357,284 records**, but contains the necessary information for further analysis. The cleaning process applied to the narratives involved lowercasing, removing boilerplate text, and handling special characters, preparing the text data for subsequent tasks like sentiment analysis or topic modeling.
